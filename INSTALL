This file serves as a kind of "quick start" to setting up a CellCC environment;
it does not document all of the functionality in CellCC.

Requirements
============

CellCC requires a few pieces of software to run:

 - perl (only tested with v5.16+, but may work with v5.8+)
 - OpenAFS, or something that provides an OpenAFS-like 'vos' command
 - AFS::Command
 - k5start
 - remctl
 - Various perl modules automatically detected by packaging

CellCC also requires a few things in your environment to do anything useful:

 - At least two OpenAFS cells
 - A working krb5 realm, with the ability to extract keytabs
 - A MySQL database

Only MySQL is supported as a database currently. CellCC uses DBI for database
access and uses pretty mundane queries, so it should be feasible to use other
SQL databases. However, the schema definitions included with CellCC are
currently MySQL-specific.

Installation
============

It is highly recommended to install CellCC using some sort of packaging
wherever possible (RPM, deb, etc). However, if you want to manually install,
run the following, as if you were installing a perl module from CPAN:

  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ make
  $ make install

By default, this will install into /usr/local. The variables you can set to
change various paths can be specified like so:

  $ perl Makefile.PL SYSCONFDIR=/etc LOCALSTATEDIR=/var/lib \
                     PREFIX=/usr BINDIR=/usr/bin

Using 'make install' in this way will only install the CellCC perl libraries
and commands, though. There are some additional documentation files in the
'doc' dir, as well as some configuration to be provided in 'etc'. Ideally, you
should install the RPM or other packaging to get all of the stuff you need.

RPM
===

In the 'packaging' dir, there is some crude scripting to help generate RPMs.
You should be able to just run the following to create an RPM for
RHEL7/CentOS7:

  $ ./packaging/rules rpm7

See './packaging/rules help' for other targets.

Note that the RPM packaging does not explicitly require everything we need. It
is missing dependencies for the following:

 - OpenAFS itself (or anything that offers an OpenAFS-like 'vos' command)
 - The AFS::Command perl library

This just makes it easier to install CellCC without having proper packaging for
those; since some environments have those installed outside of RPM.

If CellCC is ever added to a real RPM distribution (such as CentOS, EPEL, etc),
this RPM packaging stuff should probably go away, in deference to the packaging
work in downstream projects.

DB Setup
========

Of course, there is much more to using CellCC than just installing the RPM.
This is a distributed system, like AFS, and so there is more setup that must be
done.

First, you need database infrastructure before you can do much of anything.
Currently, CellCC only supports MySQL, and we provide the schema in the 'sql/'
directory. Just create a database for use with CellCC, and run that SQL to
create the relevant tables.

You also need some user credentials to access the database from CellCC tools.
If you want some people to be able to run certain "read-only" commands (like
querying status), and only allowing administrators or daemons to access
"read-write" commands (which can edit database info), then you will need two
database users: one with read-only access, and one with read-write access.

However, this is not required; you can run CellCC using a single "read-write"
database user, if you wish.

krb5 Setup
==========

You are also going to need a few krb5 "users", keytabs, and possibly AFS users,
for the daemons to authenticate as. These will be needed for the following:

 - vos. We will need to run certain OpenAFS 'vos' commands with administrative
   access, in order to dump and restore volumes. You can configure CellCC to
   use -localauth, or we can run with krb5 credentials and authenticate to AFS
   that way. For the latter, you will need to extract a keytab for such a user.

   You will need to do this for each relevant cell (either source or
   destination cells). But if each cell is capable of using the same keytab, or
   if you just want to use -localauth, then you only need to do this once.

 - remctl. Some pieces of CellCC will communicate with each other over the wire
   using a kerberized communication system called remctl. We will need a user
   to authenticate as for this. This can simply be something like
   'remctl@REALM'. You will need to create a krb5 principal for this purpose,
   as well as extract a keytab for that principal.

 - host keytabs. All hosts that dump volume blobs from OpenAFS in the "source"
   cell will need to run the remctl daemon. And so, in order to work properly,
   the remctl daemon needs a service principal to use to authenticate incoming
   connections. It is easiest if you have principals like
   host/server.example.com, but it possible to configure CellCC to use
   different service principal names.

Basic CellCC config
===================

With the included RPM packaging, the default config file for CellCC is
/etc/cellcc/cellcc.json, which is in JSON format. Commands that require
administrative access will also try to load /etc/cellcc/cellcc_admin.json,
which you can restrict access to and then use to store "admin" credentials.

At the very least, you will want to configure the following directives in
cellcc.json to get started:

  {
    db: {
      ro: {
        dsn: "DBI:mysql:database=cellcc;host=db.example.com",
        user: "readonly_username",
        pass: "readonly_password",
      },
    },

    cells: {
        // sync volumes from source.example.com to na.example.com and
        // eu.example.com
        "source.example.com": {
          "dst-cells": ["na.example.com", "eu.example.com",],
        },
    },

    remctl: {
      princ: "cellcc@EXAMPLE.COM",
      "client-keytab": "/etc/cellcc/remctl-client.keytab",
    },

    vos: {
      keytab: "/etc/cellcc/vos.keytab",
      princ: "vosadmin@EXAMPLE.COM", // optional

      // or, specify:
      // localauth: 1,
    },

    "pick-sites": {
      // This command is run when cellcc needs to create a new volume in a
      // destination cell. The command tells CellCC on what fileservers to
      // create the new volume.
      command: "/usr/local/bin/cellcc_picksites",
    },
  }

For read-write access to the database, you may want to fill in the following
values in cellcc_admin.json, and restrict access to that file:

  {
    db: {
      rw: {
        // dsn here is optional
        user: "readwrite_username",
        pass: "readonly_password",
      },
    },
  }

Hopefully the purpose of all of these values is fairly intuitive. The example
values given set up a CellCC environment where volumes from the cell
source.example.com are synced to the cells na.example.com and eu.example.com.
The database connection information is specified like a normal perl DBI DSN. We
use a principal of cellcc@EXAMPLE.COM for the remctl communication, and
vosadmin@EXAMPLE.COM for vos administrative access.

You will want all dumping/restoring machines to have access to that
configuration file. It can either be installed into AFS or some other network
file store, or you can just install the file on each machine.

CellCC daemons
==============

With a basic setup in place, you should be able to start up the relevant CellCC
daemons. We do not provide any init scripts or systemd unit files or anything
like that for these daemons, but they can be run easily from the OpenAFS
bosserver.

All CellCC daemons (and almost all CellCC commands in general) are run from a
single command: cellcc. The various daemons and other functionality are just
provided as subcommands from the main 'cellcc' script.

There is only one daemon that is central to the entire CellCC environment. This
is called the "check-server", and is run like so:

  $ cellcc check-server

This daemon will monitor the progress of synchronizing volumes via the SQL
database, and will retry sync jobs if they fail, and will notify administrators
of errors (you must configure this, of course; this was not covered in the
simple config above).

The next daemon that is required is the daemon that will dump volumes from the
"source" cell. This is called the "dump-server" and is run like so:

  $ cellcc dump-server fs1.source.example.com source.example.com na.example.com

In that example, that dump-server process will dump volumes going from cell
'source.example.com' to 'na.example.com', and it will dump the relevant volume
using an RO site on fileserver 'fs1.source.example.com'. It is intended that
this dump-server process be run on fs1.source.example.com in this example, but
that's not strictly necessary.

You must run one 'dump-server' instance for every cell you wish to synchronize
to (and every cell you wish to synchronize from, if there is more than one). So
if you want to sync volumes using 'fs1' for cell 'na', 'fs2' for 'eu, and 'fs1'
again for 'ap', then you would need to run three dump-server daemons:

On 'fs1':

  $ cellcc dump-server fs1.source.example.com source.example.com na.example.com ap.example.com

On 'fs2':

  $ cellcc dump-server fs2.source.example.com source.example.com eu.example.com

If you want to change which fileserver you dump volumes to, then you should
shutdown the dump-server process on that machine, and then start up another
dump-server instance on the new machine.

The final daemon that you need to run is the daemon that will grab volume dumps
from the dump-server, and will restore them to the destination cell and release
them. This is called the "restore-server" and is run like so:

  $ cellcc restore-server na.example.com

In this example, that restore-server instance will process dumps intended for
the cell na.example.com (wherever they may come from). This can be run on any
cell in (or at least physically close to) the na.example.com cell.

remctl daemon
=============

On all machines that run a 'dump-server' instance, you also need to have a
remctl daemon running, since this is how the restore-server instances grab the
dumps dumped by the dump-server.

On some systems (Debian systems, and some RHEL RPMs of remctl), the remctl
packaging will set up the remctl server out of the box. The cellcc RPM
packaging provides a remctld config snippet in /etc/remctl/conf.d/cellcc, but
you will need to edit that file according to the included comments.

For other systems, you need to make sure remctld is running from inetd (or
standalone, if you wish, but it's easier to do via some form of inetd), and you
need to make sure remctld is using the config snippets in /etc/remctl/conf.d/.

Configuration snippets for (x)inetd and remctld are provided in the 'doc' dir,
but of course you may need to tweak those examples to work at your site.

To test if remctl communication is working between a restore-server and a
dump-server, you can run the following command from the restore-server:

  $ ccc-debug ping-remctl <dumpserver>

That will both print out the remctl command that it will run, as well as
actually run the command. If communication is working fine, you will see a
message indicating success.

Starting a sync
===============

Syncing volumes from a 'source' cell to 'destination' cells happens when you
tell CellCC to do a sync; CellCC does not monitor volumes for changes or
anything like that. In this way, it is similar to 'vos release'; so you must
run a command to tell CellCC to start syncing volume changes.

To start such a sync, run the command:

  $ cellcc start-sync source.example.com vol.example

That will start syncing the volume 'vol.example' from cell source.example.com
to all configured destination cells in the cellcc configuration. The volume
will be synced in the "default" queue, which defaults to a restore parallelism
of 1. A different queue can be specified using the --queue option, but the
example config above doesn't define any non-default queues (the 'default' queue
always exists).

We assume that the volume has already been released in the 'source.example.com'
cell before this command is run; CellCC does not do any volume release in the
source cell.

Also note that the 'start-sync' command returns as soon as the sync is
scheduled; it does not wait for the sync to complete. It does, however, print
a "job id" on stdout, which you can use to track the progress of the sync job.

Viewing sync status
===================

You can use the "cellcc jobs" command to view the status of all running jobs.
This is printed in human-readable plain text by default, but can also be
printed in JSON with '--format json'.

Errors in syncing the volume are reported as "alerts", which are sent by
running configured commands. Look at the manpage for cellcc_config and
cellcc_check-server for details, specifically the directives
"check/alert-cmd/txt", "check/alert-cmd/json", and "check/alert-log".

Documentation
=============

All cellcc subcommands have associated manpages, and the included RPM packaging
installs all of our manpages to the appropriate place. So after installation,
the manpage for e.g. 'cellcc config' can be seen by running 'man
cellcc_config'.

To see the documentation without installing, the POD source for the manpages
can be seen in the doc/pod1/ dir. You can usually even view these like manpages
by running 'perldoc doc/pod1/cellcc_config.pod'.
